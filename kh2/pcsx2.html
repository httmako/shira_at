    <h2>Play KH2FM on PC</h2>
    <p>PCSX2 is a powerful tool that lets you emulate PS2 games on Windows. The only downside is it's difficult-to-understand setup. Let's begin with the basics:</p>
    <p>Download <a target="_blank" href="https://pcsx2.net/downloads">PCSX2 for windows</a> and install it. I personally use v1.4.0 and the screenshots here reflect that, v1.6.0 is completely different. Click YES if it tells you to upgrade DirectX.</p>
    <p>You need the BIOS of a PS2 to emulate it. Either <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.at/search?q=RIP+PS2+Bios&oq=RIP+PS2+Bios">RIP it off your own PS2</a> or just <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/playstation/other/ps2-bios-collection-complete/">download it here</a>.<br>
    Unpack the BIOS folders / data and copy them into your <span>Documents/PCSX2/bios</span> folder.<br><br>

    <p>Next download the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emuparadise.me/Sony_Playstation_2_ISOs/Kingdom_Hearts_II_-_Final_Mix+_(Japan)/151708">japanese Kingdom Hearts 2: Final Mix+</a> ISO. You may have to unpack it after downloading it with <a target="_blank" href="https://7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> first. The game file itself should be ending with <i>.iso</i></p>
    <p>Now you have to go to CDVD->Select ISO and select the .iso you just downloaded and unpacked.<br><br>

    <p>The only thing left is to configure your controls and then start the game. To configure the control setup, go to Config->Controllers->Plugin Settings <br><br>

    <br><br>and then to the first tab at the top named "Pad1". Here you can map PS2 keys to your Keyboard or Controller.<br><br>

    <p>To start a game, select System->Boot CDVD. Boot CDVD (fast) doesn't play the PS2 Intro logo, (full) plays it.<br><br>

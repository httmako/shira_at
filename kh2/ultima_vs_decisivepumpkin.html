    <h1>Ultima vs Decisive Pumpkin</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The main difference between the 2 Keyblades are their abilities:<br>
    Decisive Pumpkin has Combo Boost, which makes ground finishers stronger the more hits you landed during a combo.<br>
    Ultima has MP Hastega, which speeds up your MP regeneration by 75% as soon as you used it all up.</p>

    <h2>Difference:</h2>
    <h3>1. Damage</h3>
    <p>The 2 Keyblades have been compared with a normal ground combo against Data Roxas, who has 3168 HP.<br>
    This was tested with a Lvl.99 Sora who has 80 Strength and 64/67 Magic. (The magic varies because Ultima has 3 more magic stat than DP)<br>
    One Combo Boost equipped, no Combo / Air Combo Plus.<br>
    Tested was a whole combo attack, with 2 Default Hits and 2 Finishers.<br>
    First Roxas was blocked, then the following attacks commenced:<br>
	Counterguard -> Flash Step -> Guard Break -> Explosion<br>
    <br>
    Roxas' HP afterwards:<br>
    Decisive Pumpkin: 2925 HP (243 Damage)<br>
    Ultima: 2957 HP (211 Damage)<br>
    <br>
    A Picture for visual comparison:</p>
    <div><img alt="A picture showing that Decisive Pumpkin does more damage in one combo to roxas than ultima does" src="article_pictures/DPU_Damage_Comparison_Roxas.jpg"></div>
    <p>Decisive Pumpkin did 32 more damage than Ultima. This doesn't sound like much, but it makes the fight much quicker. Air Attacks will still do the same damage. The 3 extra magic that Ultima has barely makes a difference during a ground combo, because the only attack that does magic damage is "Explosion" (The balls that circle around you).
    <br>
    Another comparison was done with the Lingering Will boss, with 2 Combo Plus and 2 Finishing Plus abilities equipped.<br>
	A full 4 hit ground combo with 3 finishers, which consist of Guard Break -> Explosion -> Guard Break . The following picture shows his HP Bar after a full combo with both Keyblades:</p>
    <div><img alt="A picture showing that decisive pumpkin does more damage to terra in one cycle than ultima does" src="article_pictures/DPU_Damage_Comparison_Terra.jpg"></div>
    <p>Decisive Pumpkin did a lot more damage than Ultima, and that with the same attacks and finishers.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>2. MP Regeneration</h3>
    <p>The only thing Ultima does better is MP Regeneration: With Decisive Pumpkin, your MP bar needs around 22.5 seconds to restore. Ultima needs only ~17 seconds to fully recover your MP, which is way faster than any other Keyblade. These times where measured with 2 Full Bloom+, MP Haste and MP Hastera equipped, so your times may vary.<br>

    <br>
    
    <h3>3. Keyblade length</h3>
    <p>Ultima is slightly longer than Decisive Pumpkin. It's barely visible, but it's definitely longer. This doesn't make much of a difference, but it should make connecting attacks easier when dashing in with 'Slide Dash'. It also makes <a href="DodgeSlash.html">Dodge Slash</a> a little bit more viable. A .gif showing the difference:</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall, Decisive Pumpkin is a better Keyblade for doing a lot of damage with physical ground combos, but Ultima is better if you prefer to take it easy and heal a lot.</p>

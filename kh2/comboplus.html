    <h2>Combo Plus</h2>
    <p>Description: Increases Maximum combo by 1 when on the ground. Equip more to enable more combos.</p>

    <p>Many people don't like this ability, because the Boss always seems to break out of their combo before they can use their strong combo-finishers. BUT: If used correctly, Combo Plus is one of the strongest abilities in the game.</p>

    <p>Combo Plus raises your hits in a combo by one. This means that you now need to hit 3 times instead of 2 before you can use your combo-finisher. This benefits the "Combo Boost" ability immensely. Combo Boost makes your combo-finishers stronger the more hits you landed during the combo itself. This means that by equipping 2 Combo Plus' you make your finisher even stronger, but you have to hit 2 more hits.</p>
    
    <p>Here is the difference when fighting against Data Roxas with and without Combo Plus' equipped.<br>
    <img alt="" src="article_pictures/CP_Difference.png"><br>
    You deal (nearly) a whole Health-Bar more damage than without any Combo Plus' equipped. You don't even have to do anything special. Roxas will counterattack you after your combo-finisher (Explosion) automatically, no matter if you have a Combo Plus or not.</p>

    <p>This also greatly helps fighting the Lingering Will. The Lingering will takes more damage the more you hit him. He automatically counterattacks after a while and resets this counter though. Equipping Combo Plus makes him more vulnerable in a shorter amount of time, because combo-finishers are slow and add a lot of unnecessary Revenge Value.</p>

    <p>The difficulty with this ability is the usage. You have to find out how you can use it effectively without the enemy escaping and counterattacking you during your long combo.</p>

    <p>Here are 2 .gif that show the difference perfectly. You deal more damage, and Roxas only counterattacks AFTER your combo both times.</p>

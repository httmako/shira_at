    <h2>Good gummiship design</h2>
    
    <p>Getting hit in a gummi mission reduces your "score level", so it is best to never get hit.<br>
    This can very easily be achieved with the donut ship design.</p>
    <img alt="" src="article_pictures/Gummi_Design.png"><br>
    <p>You simply build only on the outher edge of the designer.<br>
    In the end you should have a donut (or pipe-looking) ship which can automatically dodge any enemy shots without needing to move.<br>
    Weapons, Cockpits and Thrusters can be put into the blocks that build the donut shape.<br>
    Normal enemy attacks and even boss attacks can be dodged automatically, but explosions can still hit your ship (or the cannonballs from the haunted ship mission).<br>
    The design in action:</p>

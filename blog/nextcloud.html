<h3 id="about">About Nextcloud</h3>
<p>
Nextcloud is like your own google drive hosted on your server.<br>
You can create accounts for other people and even install addons like a Kanbanboard or ToDo-List.<br>
It uses PHP and is quite easy to install.<br>
Similar programs are Seafile, Owncloud and FileRun.<br>
<b style="color:red;">[NOTE]:</b><br> I personally do not use nextcloud anymore.<br>
For my home-setup TinyFileManager is more than enough. Link: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager">https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager</a><br>
It is a very simple web file manager in one single PHP file. You can upload, download, rename and watch your files in a browser.<br>
An alternative to tinyfilemanager and nextcloud is FileBrowser, Link: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser">https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser</a><br>
</p>

<h3 id="whyselfhost">Why self-host your files</h3>
<p>
It's nice to have ownership over your own files. No one can read your files except if they have your login.<br>
It's faster than Google Drive because you use it on your own server. No background-activities or virus-scans will slow down the uploading or downloading of your files.<br>
<br>

I personally really like <a href="https://nextcloud.com" target="_blank">nextcloud</a>, it's very easy to setup and just works straight out of the box.<br>
Owncloud is - from my research - replaced by nextcloud. (Like LibreOffice replaces OpenOffice)<br>
<br>

But: Nextcloud is a bit overloaded if you only want to quickly upload files.<br>
Other alternatives like Droppy are either not up-to-date or use non-PHP solutions that require extra setup.<br>
<br>

For very simple and "easy uploading" of files I personally use <a href="https://github.com/marekrei/encode-explorer" target="_blank">encode-explorer</a>. Very easy to setup but it neither has security for uploaded files nor many other things. But it works very well as a mini filehosting.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="nextcloud">Installing Nextcloud</h3>
<p>
Requirements: Have a MySQL Database and webserver with PHP installed.<br>(On Debian: <span>sudo apt-get install mariadb-server apache2 php</span>)<br>
<br>

To setup a simple MySQL Database:<br>
<pre>
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo mysql -u root -p
&lt;ENTER&gt;
CREATE DATABASE ncdb;
CREATE USER 'ncdbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyOwnPasswordHere0?';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ncdb.* TO 'ncdbuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</pre>

<br>
Then you need the required PHP packages:<br>
<span>sudo apt-get install php-zip php-xml php-curl php-gd php-mbstring php-mysql</span><br>

<br>
Before installing nextcloud make sure the folder you want your cloud to be in has write permissions from the PHP/web user.<br>
If you use Apache2&PHP on Debian and want to use the /cloud folder then you can use the following commands:
<pre>
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/cloud
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/cloud
</pre>
This makes the web-user own the cloud directory and be able to write / create files in it.<br>

<br>
To download nextcloud simply visit their website and click on "Get Nextcloud" in the top right. There you can download the "Web Installer" package which is only one .php file.<br>
To directly download it to your webserver you can use the following command:<br>
<pre>
sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/installer/setup-nextcloud.php
</pre>
Or you can download it locally and copy it to your webfolder (in this case <span>/var/www/html/cloud</span>).<br>
Now visit the website with a browser of your choice.<br>
<br>
If it says an error along the lines of "can't write" then you have to use the chown command again to make the directory writeable for the www-data user again.<br>
(<span>sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/cloud</span>)<br>
<br>
Selecting install directory: If your install file is in /cloud then you can enter <span>.</span><br>
After clicking OK it will install nextcloud for you. after finishing you can then enter your configuration.<br>
Enter your new Admin User and Password and then select MySQL as your database-provider and enter the details from earlier.<br>
<br>
To create users you can simply visit the "User" setting on the top right by clicking on your Icon.

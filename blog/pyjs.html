<h1>A short comparison between Python3 and NodeJS</h1>

<h3 id="sum">Summary</h3>
<p>I wanted to analyze some chat-logs I got from a twitch stream (with permission from the streamer).<br>
The chat messages are all saved in files named after the day they were sent, and all of these files are in one single folder. I built a short script that reads through all of them, line by line, splits up the words that the user wrote and counted how many times a specific word was said (by any user). So basically "word appearences" of each word over all the days he/she was streaming.<br>
I first wrote it in Python3, but then I wondered how NodeJS, the tool with which I capture the chat messages, would compare to it.<br>
TL;DR: Both have approximately the same speed. ( 8.4 seconds for 74 files with 2 million lines, +/- 100ms )</p>

<h3 id="tec">Technical Explanation</h3>
<p>Both the NodeJS and Python3 program read each file in, split the lines, then split the words that the user wrote and just add them to a dictionary.<br>
The index of that dictionary is the word and the value of it the number of appearences. To sort this dictionary I just add the index and value, as a list, to a list, and sort it by the value aka. the second item of the list.<br>
To further elaborate this:</p>
<p>
File-Lines: <span>19:37 - UserName - Chat Message Chat</span><br>
Dictionary: <span>stats["Message"] = 1</span><br>
Sort-List:  <span>list = [["Message",1],["Chat",2]]</span><br>
</p>

<p>Then the List will get sorted by the second value (The count of the word appearence) and written as a JSON string to a file.</p>

<h3 id="res">Test-Case Result</h3>
<p>This particular test-case was made from 74 days worth of chat logs, which range from 20KB to 4MB in size.<br>
This accumulated to over 2 Million lines of chat messages.<br>
2 Million lines read in, split into words, counted in a dictionary, put into a list, sorted the list and dumped it as a .json.<br>

</pre><br>
The more often I ran this, the closer <b>both got to an average of 8.4 seconds.</b><br>
Ofcourse it's easier to write such things in Python, but for me it is good to know that I do not get any speed penalty for using NodeJS.

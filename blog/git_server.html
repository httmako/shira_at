<h2 id="comparison">comparison of git servers</h2>
<p>
There are many different open source git servers available.<br>
I have used many and will try to compare them by experience and features.<br>
For a comparison made by gitea visit <a href="https://docs.gitea.com/next/installation/comparison">https://docs.gitea.com/next/installation/comparison</a>
</p>

<h3>Gitlab</h3>
<p>
Source: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">https://about.gitlab.com/</a><br>
Gitlab is, to my knowledge, the biggest and best suited git server for large groups or enterprise settings.<br>
It has the most features and even an inbuilt CI/CD pipeline.<br>
I would recommend it for companies or very big groups, but not for small deployments at home or for a small group of friends.
</p>
<h3>Gitea / Forgejo</h3>
<p>
Source: <a href="https://about.gitea.com/">https://about.gitea.com/</a> / <a href="https://forgejo.org/">https://forgejo.org/</a><br>
Gitea is a small git server that has a github-like feeling.<br>
It has many features but uses less resources than gitlab and is suited for smaller deployments, for example a group of friends.<br>
Forgejo is a fork of gitea and is recommended over gitea by security enthusiasts online.
</p>
<h3>Gogs</h3>
<p>
Source: <a href="https://gogs.io/">https://gogs.io/</a><br>
Gogs is the smallest git server which still has a good UI.<br>
It feels similar to gitea but uses even less resources and runs on the smallest of raspberry pi's.<br>
I would recommend Gogs for small homeserver deployments or private git servers in general.
</p>

<h2 id="whyusegogs">Why use gogs?</h2>
<p>
Gogs uses barely any resources and has a good looking UI with many features.<br>
Gitea used (tested in 2022) ~5% cpu when idle on my raspberry pi. Gogs uses 0% cpu when idle.<br>
Gogs is a single executable written in Golang and all it requires is to have git installed.<br>
BUT: The jenkins gogs module has vulnerabilities which haven't been fixed in months, so if you need a good and secure jenkins addon for your git server then choose Gitea or GitLab instead.
</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>
Requirements: Have git installed (example: <span>sudo apt-get install git</span>)
<br><br>
Get the latest version of the gogs binary from the release page: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases">https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases</a><br>
Unpack the archive, go into the unpacked folder and use "./gogs web" to start the server. The configuration resides at "custom/conf/app.ini".<br>
<br>
If you want to start it as a systemd service you can use the service file found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/scripts/systemd/gogs.service">https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/scripts/systemd/gogs.service</a><br>
<br>
To setup a reverse proxy with nginx you can use the most simple proxy_pass configuration:<br>
<pre>
server_name git.example.com;
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
}

# or with sub url

server_name example.com;
location /git/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
}
</pre><br>
If you get an error message when pushing set the nginx "client_max_body_size" config to "50m" or higher.
Don't forget to change the "custom/conf/app.ini" with your new URL:<br>
<pre>
[server]
EXTERNAL_URL = https://example.com/git/
ROOT_URL = https://example.com/git/
</pre>

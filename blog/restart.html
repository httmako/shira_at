<h1>Automatically restart your Service with systemd</h1>

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
<p>I've searched for ways to automatically restart my application if it crashes, and have only found solutions which need extra software or something like 'forever'.<br>
After a while I found out that you can do this with systemd, the init-process for most linux distrubutions nowadays.<br>
This has 2 major advantages: It uses the internal journal for logging and it can easily be controlled with systemctl.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example with NodeJS</h3>
<p>Creating your own systemd service is quite easy, as it's only a file that you have to create.<br>
An example:<br>
First create your service file and add it to <i>/etc/systemd/system</i>. This example uses a NodeJS server, so the file could be named <span>/etc/systemd/system/myapp.service</span><br>
The Lines are pretty self-explanatory, but <b>don't forget to change it to your own settings!</b><br>
Contents of the .service file:<br>
<pre>
[Unit]
Description=My NodeJS Server

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/user/myapp/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
SyslogIdentifier=myapp
User=user
Group=user
Environment=NODE_ENV=production PORT=3000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</pre><br>
Now we are ready to start it. Systemd services can be controlled using the <i>systemctl</i> command. It's quite easy to use:<br>
<pre><span>sudo systemctl start myapp</pre></span>
This command simply starts your service. It will automatically restart 5 seconds after crashing thanks to our 6/7th line in the service files.<br>
To automatically start your service on system startup simply run the following command: <pre><span>sudo systemctl enable myapp</pre></span>
To check the status use <span>status</span> instead of enable. With <span>stop</span> you can stop the service, and to disable the auto-startup simply use <span>disable</span> instead of enable.<br><br>
The <span>status</span> command also shows you an excerpt of the log. To see the full log use the <span>journalctl</span> command and look for your SyslogIdentifier, which in this case is <span>myapp</span> (which was set in the .service file)</p>

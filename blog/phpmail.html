<h1>Checking why PHP Mail isn't working</h1>

<h3 id="problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>
The problem: Emails aren't being sent out. In this specific case it was the forum software "MyBB" not sending registration emails to users.
</p>

<h3 id="script">Test Script</h3>
<p>
The first thing to do is: Test if it actually sends the email.<br>
For this I recommend using a non-gmail email like one from "temp-mail.org" or similar.<br>
Simply copy and paste this PHP file to a browsable location in your web folder.<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Change <span>user@example.com</span> to the email you want your server to send it from, for example <span>noreply@yourdomain.net</span>. Change <span>me@hotmail.com</span> to your own email address.<br><br>
<pre>&lt;?php
error_reporting(-1);
ini_set('display_errors', 'On');
set_error_handler("var_dump");
echo "Running: ";
$headers = 'From: user@example.com' . "\r\n" .
'Reply-To: user@example.com';
$success = mail('me@hotmail.com', 'The papers for your report', "Hope you can use them! BR", $headers);
if (!$success) {
    echo "ERROR: '";
    $errorMessage = error_get_last()['message'];
    echo $errorMessage;
    echo "'";
}else{
  echo " Successfull!";
}
?>
</pre>
If you now visit the website and it says "Running:  Successfull!" then PHP mail is working fine.<br>
If it says "ERROR: " then try to install <span>sendmail</span>. It mostly fails to send if you don't have sendmail installed, so install it and try the script again.(Command: <span>sudo apt-get install sendmail</span>)<br>
<br>
If it says "Successfull!" now but the email is still not arriving to your users then head over to the next section.
</p>

<h3 id="sendmail">Checking Sendmail</h3>
<p>
If Emails are still not sending you can check the sendmail logs and mail spools.<br>
<br>
To check if a mail was actually send you can use the following command:<br>
<pre>
sudo less /var/log/mail.log
</pre>
This contains information from the journal which tells you if mails were accepted for delivery.<br>
<br>
If they were accepted for delivery then check the mail spool of www-data for returning mails.<br>
<pre>
sudo less /var/spool/mail/www-data
</pre>
In here are emails you get back from successfully sending one with the php mail function.<br>
In my case there were a lot of emails from gmail returning to me, because gmail could not verify my domain. The information why mails aren't sending are contained in the body of the returning mail.<br>
My example:<br>

This error message means the following:<br>
The Server this email was sent from is missing an IPv6 entry that redirects to the paired domain. This means that the domain <span>example.com</span> correctly redirects to the server's IP <span>1.2.3.4</span>, but the IPv6 address of the Server is forgotten and does not reverse-lookup to the (correct) <span>example.com</span> domain.<br>
<br>
To fix this simply add an A record to your domain configuration that points to the IPv6 address of your server. To see the IP addresses of your server you can use the <span>ip a</span> command.

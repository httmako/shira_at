<h1>Comparing ZIP compression methods</h1>

</ul>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>
This is a comparison between compression methods (mainly 7zip and unix tools).<br>
This is not an analysis about the different compression methods or how they compare in their algorithm against each other.<br>
This is a simple comparison of the compression size of a small set of data.<br>
<br>
LZMA2 is worse if you use multiple threads. It is recommended to use 1 or max. 2 threads for compression, because if you have more than 2 it splits the whole archive in 2 and makes the compression of similar content 2 times instead of once. (This information can be found in the 7zip documentation)
</p>

<h3 id="images">Comparison with Images</h3>
<p>
This test was conducted with 35 images that are part of a cosplay shooting from Megumi Koneko. A sample picture can be seen <a target="_blank" href="files/megumi_koneko_katherine_regular_21.jpg">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Warning: These tests have been done with jpg images. The results for png images could be different.<br>
<br>
All compressions have been done with the "Compression Level" set to "Ultra". (And as mentioned above with only 1 Thread)<br>
<br>
The size of these 35 images without any compression: 267198693 (<span>du -sb</span>) / in a readable size: 255MB (<span>du -sh</span>)
<table>

</table>
<br>
As you can see the best algorithm was 7zip's PPMd method.<br>
An important detail here: It took way longer to compress it with PPMd than with a default linux <span>zip</span> command. The difference between the first and last is only ~3.4MB, but the time it took (with only 1 thread) was way bigger for the PPMd method than for a simple zip.<br>
<br>
To summarize this: <b>There is no clear winner here.</b>
</p>

<h3 id="text">Comparison with Text</h3>
<p>
This test was conducted with 4677 text files in 1670 folders. The size of the files were 24.8MB (Size on disk was 34.2MB).<br>
<br>
All 7zip compressions have been done with the "Compression Level" set to "Ultra". (And as mentioned above with only 1 Thread)<br>

<br>
Every text file had the same "Heading" text, like a logo made with text characters. This explains the bigger size of the debian zip compression as the small dictionary size is a burdgen for this heading that is present in every file.<br>
<br>
There are 2 main sections: The 7zip modern methods on the top that are all 2.8MB or lower and the default zip methods at the bottom with 8.1MB or higher.<br>
<br>
The default method for 7zip is the LZMA2 method, and this comparison shows why: It's perfect for text compression. If you raise the word size a bit it's nearly as good as the PPMd method.<br>
<br>
To summarize this: <b>The winners are the new 7zip methods PPMd, lzma and lzma2</b>

<h1>Bypass cors restrictions in javascript with PHP</h1>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>
Modern Browsers don't allow you to send requests to another website that don't have the Cross-Origin Header set.<br>
So if you want to get resources from another server then you would sooner or later run into problems.<br>
<br>
My specific problem:<br>
I wanted to write a browser-based viewer of someone's REST API. I couldn't get them via a Javascript request, but I could get them with other programming languages.<br>
<br>
Also, please try to <b>ask for permission before grabbing someone else's data!</b><br>
</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>
PHP doesn't care about Cross Origin requests and is easy to setup.<br>
<br>
For my problem I built myself a small "PHP Fetcher" to simply get the Resource and echo it as a response.<br>
This way I can simply write a Javascript Request to my own Server and get the response without many more workarounds.<br>
<br>
The PHP code I settled on:<br>
<pre>
Filename: t.php
Full Content:

&lt;?php
$json = file_get_contents('https://example.com/api/v1/status?key=XXX&server='.$_GET['id']);
$arr = json_decode($json, true); //Accessible Array from JSON answer
echo $arr['response']['serverstatus'];
?&gt;
</pre>
<br>
Now I can simply make an ajax call from javascript and access this resource over my own PHP file:<br>
<pre>
Javascript:

return $.ajax({
  type: "GET",
  url: "https://myserver.com/t.php?id="+id
}).done(function(data) {
  document.body.innerHTML += data+"&lt;br>";
});
</pre>
<br>
This works well for my needs and is a quick and easy fix for my problem.<br>
<b>Warning: This is NOT made for production. Do not spam or abuse a service with this.</b><br>
<br>
This mini-php-script is not optimized. There is neither a rate-limit nor caching.<br>
With caching you would relieve the strain on the target API and optimize your service.<br>
With rate-limits you would secure your own service from getting into trouble for spamming other services.<br>
